This code automates software updates for machines in a manufacturing environment. It determines the operating system (Windows or Linux) of the machine it's running on and then constructs the appropriate command for updating software packages. On Windows systems, it uses Chocolatey (`choco`) to upgrade all installed packages, while on Linux systems, it employs `apt-get` to update package lists and upgrade installed packages. The script then executes the update command in the shell environment and displays any errors that occur during the process. Its purpose is to ensure that machines stay updated with the latest software patches and features, improving security and performance in the manufacturing environment.
